# Functional Specifications for the Schema Repository

## 1. **Schema Management Capabilities**
   - **Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) Operations**:
     - Users must be able to create new schema definitions, update existing ones, retrieve schemas (both content and metadata), and delete schemas if no longer needed.
     - Versioning must be enforced, and users must have the ability to maintain multiple versions of a schema.
   - **Schema Metadata**:
     - Each schema should have associated metadata that includes, but is not limited to:
       - `$schemaName` (name of the schema)
       - `$schemaVersion` (version of the schema)
       - `$author` (creator of the schema)
       - `$description` (description of what the schema represents)
       - `$license` (license terms, if any)
       - `tags` (for categorizing schemas).
     - Metadata management should be decoupled from schema payloads and managed independently but visible alongside the schema.

## 2. **Schema Composition**
   - **Modular Schema Design**:
     - The repository should support schema composition, allowing users to break down larger schemas into smaller, reusable components.
     - Users should be able to compose schemas by referencing other schemas or schema parts stored in the repository.
     - The system should support `$ref` resolution across schemas, allowing schema components to be reused across different schema definitions.
   - **Inheritance and Extension**:
     - Enable schema inheritance where new schemas can extend existing schemas (e.g., using `allOf`, `oneOf`, `anyOf`).
     - Support the ability to define templates or base schemas that others can extend.
   
## 3. **Schema Validation & Integrity**
   - **Schema Validation**:
     - Automatically validate schema definitions before they are saved to ensure they are syntactically correct based on JSON Schema standards (or any other supported schema standards like Avro, OpenAPI, etc.).
   - **Version Validation**:
     - Ensure that each schemaâ€™s version is unique to prevent conflicts.
     - Implement backward and forward compatibility checks between schema versions, warning users of potential breaking changes.
   
## 4. **Governance & Access Control**
   - **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**:
     - Define roles such as `Schema Creator`, `Schema Reviewer`, `Schema Consumer`, and `Admin` for managing access rights.
     - Permissions should control who can create, modify, delete, or consume schemas.
   - **Approval Workflow**:
     - Support an approval workflow where newly created or updated schemas need to be reviewed and approved by designated stakeholders before they are published for use.
     - Notifications should be sent to reviewers and approvers when action is required.
   
## 5. **Schema Versioning**
   - **Automatic Version Management**:
     - The system should track and manage schema versions. Any update to a schema should increment its version.
     - Users must have the ability to view the change history of each schema, including timestamps, authors, and descriptions of the changes.
   - **Schema Deprecation**:
     - Support schema version deprecation, allowing older schema versions to be deprecated but still accessible for backward compatibility.
   
## 6. **Schema Querying & Discovery**
   - **Search & Filtering**:
     - Provide powerful search capabilities to allow users to find schemas based on:
       - Schema name, version, author, tags, description, etc.
     - Support advanced filtering (e.g., find all schemas created by a particular user, within a date range, or related to a specific domain).
   - **Schema Relationships**:
     - Allow users to visualize schema dependencies and relationships (e.g., which schemas reference or are referenced by other schemas).
   
## 7. **Productivity & Reusability**
   - **Schema Templates**:
     - Provide a library of predefined schema templates for common use cases, which users can easily extend or customize.
   - **Schema Cloning**:
     - Users should be able to clone existing schemas to create a base for new schemas, which can be further customized.
   - **Code Generation**:
     - Provide code generation capabilities (e.g., generating TypeScript interfaces, Java classes, etc.) directly from the schemas, improving productivity for developers.
   - **Schema Diffing**:
     - Implement a schema diff tool that highlights differences between two versions of a schema, assisting users in understanding changes made.

## 8. **Integration & API Support**
   - **Public API**:
     - Expose the repository via a RESTful API to enable external systems to query, create, and update schemas.
     - API should include endpoints to retrieve schemas by name, version, and metadata, and for managing schemas programmatically.
   - **Schema Validation API**:
     - Provide an API endpoint where external systems can validate their payloads against schemas stored in the repository.
     - This would allow teams to submit JSON payloads and validate them against existing schema definitions.
   
## 9. **Schema Version Lifecycle Management**
   - **Version Control**:
     - Integrate with version control systems (VCS) to enable schema lifecycle management. For instance, each schema can have lifecycle states like `Draft`, `Review`, `Published`, `Deprecated`.
   - **Release Cycles**:
     - Provide functionality to associate schema versions with release cycles, allowing teams to bundle specific schema versions with software releases.

## 10. **Schema Compliance & Auditing**
   - **Audit Logs**:
     - Every change to a schema should be tracked, including who made the change, when it was made, and what was changed (metadata, content, etc.).
     - An audit trail should be accessible for compliance and troubleshooting purposes.
   - **Schema Certification**:
     - Allow certain schemas to be marked as "certified" after passing through additional governance or validation checks. Certified schemas can be trusted for mission-critical applications.
   
## 11. **Notifications & Alerts**
   - **Schema Subscription**:
     - Allow users to subscribe to changes on specific schemas or schema families (e.g., they can be notified of new versions, updates, or deprecations).
   - **Notification Channels**:
     - Support various notification mechanisms (email, Slack, etc.) to notify users about schema changes, review requests, approval status, etc.
   
## 12. **Operational & Deployment Aspects**
   - **Scaling**:
     - The repository should be designed to scale horizontally as the number of schemas and the frequency of updates increase.
   - **High Availability**:
     - Ensure the repository supports high availability through replication and failover mechanisms.
   - **Backup & Recovery**:
     - Implement robust backup and recovery mechanisms to ensure that schemas are not lost in case of a disaster.

## 13. **User Interface (UI/UX)**
   - **Schema Explorer**:
     - Provide a user-friendly web interface where users can browse, search, and manage schemas.
     - Allow users to view schemas in both raw JSON format and a more structured, readable format (e.g., collapsible sections).
   - **Schema Composition UI**:
     - Provide an intuitive interface for composing schemas from existing components. Users should be able to drag and drop schema elements to compose new schemas.
   - **Version Comparison UI**:
     - Provide a side-by-side comparison view for schema versions, helping users easily visualize changes.

## 14. **Security Considerations**
   - **Data Encryption**:
     - Ensure that all schema data is encrypted both at rest and in transit.
   - **API Security**:
     - Enforce authentication and authorization for API access, using OAuth, JWT tokens, or other enterprise-standard mechanisms.
