## 1. Introduction

In any sophisticated system, especially one designed for policy enforcement and access control, the relationships between models are crucial to its functionality, scalability, and security. These models define the entities within the system, such as users, groups, roles, resources, and policies, and their relationships dictate how these entities interact with one another. Understanding these relationships is essential for grasping how the system enforces policies, manages access, and adapts to the complex needs of an organization.

This guide provides a comprehensive exploration of the key models and policies within an access control system. It delves into their relationships, the orchestration of services, and the dynamic evaluation of policies to create a secure and adaptable environment. Whether you're designing a new system or managing an existing one, this guide will help you understand the foundational elements of access control and how to implement them effectively.

## 3. Types of Policies

### 3.1 Principal Policies: Direct User Permissions

**Purpose and Scope**: Principal Policies specify the permissions for individual users, defining what actions they can perform on resources. They provide granular control, tailored to the needs of specific users.

**Attributes**:
- **Principal ID**: Unique identifier for the user.
- **Rules**: Actions the user is allowed or denied.

### 5.2 Resource Creation and Policy Binding: Protecting What Matters

Resources need protection from the moment they are created, with policies ensuring appropriate access controls.

**Steps Involved**:
1. **Resource Definition and Classification**: Define the resource and classify it based on its sensitivity.
2. **Automatic Policy Assignment**: Automatically apply default policies to protect the resource.
3. **Resource Ownership and Delegation**: Assign ownership and delegate rights as needed.
