## 1. Authorization Service

The Authorization Service is critical for securing access to the Pola system. It ensures that only authenticated users can perform operations within the system by issuing and managing JWT (JSON Web Tokens). The Authorization Service API provides endpoints for user login and token refresh operations.

### **1.1 POST `/auth/login` - Login User and Return JWT Token**

**Description**: Authenticates a user by verifying their credentials. Upon successful login, it returns a JWT token that must be included in the Authorization header for subsequent requests to access protected routes.

**Example Request**:

```bash
curl -X POST https://pola.ai:4000/v1/auth/login \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
  "username": "exampleUser",
  "password": "examplePassword"
}'
```

**Example Response**:

```json
{
  "token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9..."
}
```

**Mandatory Attributes**:
- `username`: The username of the user attempting to log in.
- `password`: The user's password.

**Optional Attributes**:
- None.

**Considerations**:
- Ensure secure handling of credentials, including hashing passwords.
- Implement rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks.

### **1.2 POST `/auth/refresh-token` - Refresh the JWT Token**

**Description**: Refreshes an existing JWT token before it expires. This endpoint helps maintain session continuity without requiring the user to log in again.

**Example Request**:

```bash
curl -X POST https://pola.ai:4000/v1/auth/refresh-token \
-H "Authorization: Bearer <old-token>" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

**Example Response**:

```json
{
  "token": "new-JWT-token"
}
```

**Mandatory Attributes**:
- The old JWT token must be provided in the Authorization header.

**Optional Attributes**:
- None.

**Considerations**:
- Ensure that the old token is still valid and has not been tampered with.
- Implement token rotation policies to enhance security.

## 7. Policy Definition Framework

Pola's Policy Definition Framework enables the creation of flexible and powerful policies that can be applied across various entities within the system. The framework supports multiple types of policies, including Principal Policies, Resource Policies, Group Policies, Role Policies, Derived Roles, and Export Variables. Each policy type has a specific purpose and structure, allowing for fine-grained access control.

### **7.1 Principal Policies**

Principal Policies define rules for specific principals, such as users, groups, or roles. These policies specify what actions a principal can perform on resources and under what conditions.

**Example Principal Policy**:

```json
{
  "apiVersion": "api.agsiri.dev/v1",
  "name": "PrincipalPolicy1",
  "principalPolicy": {
    "principal": "user123",
    "version": "1.0",
    "rules": [
      {
        "effect": "allow",
        "action": "read",
        "resource": "arn:aws:s3:::example_bucket"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Considerations**:
- Principal Policies should be carefully crafted to ensure that only authorized actions are allowed for the specified principal.
- Consider using variables and conditions to make policies more dynamic and context-aware.

### **7.2 Resource Policies**

Resource Policies define rules for specific resources, specifying who can perform what actions on those resources and under what conditions.

**Example Resource Policy**:

```json
{
  "apiVersion": "api.agsiri.dev/v1",
  "name": "Resource

Policy1",
  "resourcePolicy": {
    "resource": "arn:aws:s3:::example_bucket",
    "version": "1.0",
    "rules": [
      {
        "effect": "deny",
        "action": "delete",
        "principal": "user123"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Considerations**:
- Resource Policies should be designed to protect critical resources from unauthorized access or modification.
- Use conditions and variables to make resource policies adaptable to different scenarios.

### **7.3 Group Policies**

Group Policies apply to groups of users, defining what actions group members can perform on resources.

**Example Group Policy**:

```json
{
  "apiVersion": "api.agsiri.dev/v1",
  "name": "GroupPolicy1",
  "groupPolicy": {
    "group": "Engineering",
    "version": "1.0",
    "rules": [
      {
        "effect": "allow",
        "action": "update",
        "resource": "arn:aws:s3:::example_bucket"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Considerations**:
- Group Policies can simplify policy management by applying rules to entire groups rather than individual users.
- Ensure that group policies align with organizational roles and responsibilities.

### **7.4 Role Policies**

Role Policies define rules for specific roles within the system, specifying what actions role members can perform on resources.

**Example Role Policy**:

```json
{
  "apiVersion": "api.agsiri.dev/v1",
  "name": "RolePolicy1",
  "rolePolicy": {
    "role": "Admin",
    "version": "1.0",
    "rules": [
      {
        "effect": "allow",
        "action": "delete",
        "resource": "arn:aws:s3:::example_bucket"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Considerations**:
- Role Policies are useful for defining permissions based on job functions or responsibilities.
- Ensure that role policies are consistent with the organization's access control strategy.

### **7.5 Derived Roles**

Derived Roles allow for the dynamic creation of roles based on specific conditions or attributes.

**Example Derived Role**:

```json
{
  "apiVersion": "api.agsiri.dev/v1",
  "name": "DerivedRole1",
  "derivedRoles": {
    "name": "TemporaryAdmin",
    "definitions": [
      {
        "condition": "time >= '2024-01-01T00:00:00Z' && time <= '2024-01-31T23:59:59Z'",
        "role": "Admin"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Considerations**:
- Derived Roles can provide temporary or conditional access based on specific criteria.
- Ensure that the conditions for derived roles are clear and unambiguous.

### **7.6 Export Variables**

Export Variables allow policies to define and share variables that can be used in other policies or contexts.

**Example Export Variable**:

```json
{
  "apiVersion": "api.agsiri.dev/v1",
  "name": "ExportVariable1",
  "exportVariables": {
    "name": "CurrentTime",
    "definitions": {
      "time": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z"
    }
  }
}
```

**Considerations**:
- Export Variables can make policies more modular and reusable.
- Ensure that exported variables are well-documented and understood by policy authors.

### **7.7 Policy Conditions**

Pola's Policy Definition Framework supports the use of conditions to make policies more dynamic and context-aware. Conditions allow you to specify the circumstances under which a policy rule applies.

**Example Policy Condition**:

```json
{
  "effect": "allow",
  "action": "read",
  "resource": "arn:aws:s3:::example_bucket",
  "condition": {
    "StringEquals": {
      "aws:username": "user123"
    }
  }
}
```

**Considerations**:
- Conditions should be used to add flexibility and specificity to policies.
- Ensure that conditions are correctly evaluated and do not introduce unintended access.

## 8. Orchestration of Policies

Orchestration of policies in Pola involves coordinating the application, evaluation, and enforcement of multiple policies across the system. This process ensures that access control is consistently applied according to the defined policies and that any conflicts or overlaps are resolved effectively.

### **8.1 Policy Evaluation Order**

When multiple policies apply to a particular request, Pola evaluates them in a specific order to determine the final outcome:

1. **Explicit Deny**: If any policy explicitly denies access, the request is denied, regardless of other policies.
2. **Explicit Allow**: If no explicit denies are found, and a policy explicitly allows the request, access is granted.
3. **Implicit Deny**: If no explicit allow is found, the request is implicitly denied.

**Considerations**:
- Ensure that policies are designed with a clear understanding of the evaluation order.
- Use explicit allows and denies judiciously to avoid unintended consequences.

### **8.2 Policy Conflicts**

Policy conflicts can arise when multiple policies apply to the same resource or action but have contradictory rules. Pola's orchestration process includes conflict resolution strategies to handle these situations.

**Conflict Resolution Strategies**:
- **Explicit Deny Takes Precedence**: If one policy explicitly denies access, it overrides any allows.
- **Most Specific Policy Wins**: If two policies conflict, the one with more specific conditions or scopes takes precedence.

**Example Conflict Resolution**:

```json
[
  {
    "principal": "user123",
    "action": "read",
    "resource": "arn:aws:s3:::example_bucket",
    "policies": [
      {
        "effect": "deny",
        "action": "read",
        "resource": "arn:aws:s3:::example_bucket",
        "condition": {
          "StringEquals": {
            "aws:username": "user123"
          }
        }
      },
      {
        "effect": "allow",
        "action": "read",
        "resource": "arn:aws:s3:::example_bucket"
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

In this example, the explicit deny takes precedence, and the request is denied.

**Considerations**:
- Design policies with conflict resolution in mind to avoid unintended blocks or allows.
- Regularly review and update policies to reflect changes in organizational structure or access requirements.

### **8.3 Policy Simulation and Testing**

Before applying policies in a live environment, it's crucial to simulate and test them to ensure they behave as expected. Pola provides endpoints for simulating policy evaluations without enforcing them, allowing you to verify the correctness of your policies.

**Example Policy Simulation**:

```bash
curl -X POST https://pola.ai:4000/v1/policies/simulate \
-H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
  "principal": "user123",
  "action": "write",
  "resource": "arn:aws:s3:::example_bucket",
  "context": {
    "time": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z",
    "ipAddress": "192.168.1.1"
  }
}'
```

**Considerations**:
- Use simulation results to identify potential issues or conflicts in your policies.
- Regularly test policies as part of your access control strategy to ensure they continue to meet organizational needs.
