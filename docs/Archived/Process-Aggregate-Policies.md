Aggregating policies for a principal and resource is a critical process in determining whether the principal has the necessary permissions to perform actions on a particular resource. The process involves gathering all relevant policies that apply to the principal, either directly or indirectly, through their roles, groups, and derived roles, as well as the policies associated with the resource. Here's a step-by-step explanation of how this aggregation process works:

### Step 1: Identify the Principal and Resource
- **Input:** Principal ID, Resource ARI (Agsiri Resource Identifier)
- **Goal:** To begin the aggregation, you need to know the specific principal and resource for which you are determining access permissions.

### Step 2: Initialize the Aggregation Process
- **Input:** Principal ID and Resource ARI
- **Goal:** Start the aggregation by initializing the context that will hold all policies relevant to the principal and resource.

### Step 3: Retrieve Direct Principal Policies
- **Action:** Query the database for any policies directly associated with the principal.
- **Logic:**
  - Search within the `PolicyModel` collection for documents where `principalPolicy.principal` matches the given principal ID.
  - Collect all these policies.
- **Output:** A list of policies directly associated with the principal.
- **Why it’s important:** These policies apply specifically to the principal and are the first layer of access control.

### Step 4: Retrieve Group Memberships and Policies
- **Action:** Determine the groups to which the principal belongs and retrieve the policies associated with those groups.
- **Logic:**
  - Use a membership resolver service to find all groups the principal is a member of.
  - Query the `PolicyModel` collection for documents where `groupPolicy.group` matches any of the principal’s group IDs.
  - Collect all these group policies.
- **Output:** A list of group policies applicable to the principal.
- **Why it’s important:** Group policies extend the principal’s permissions based on their membership in specific groups.

### Step 5: Retrieve Role Assignments and Policies
- **Action:** Determine the roles assigned to the principal and retrieve the policies associated with those roles.
- **Logic:**
  - Use the membership resolver to identify all roles assigned to the principal.
  - Query the `PolicyModel` collection for documents where `rolePolicy.role` matches any of the principal’s role IDs.
  - Collect all these role policies.
- **Output:** A list of role policies applicable to the principal.
- **Why it’s important:** Roles often define the principal’s capabilities in a broader sense, and role policies dictate what actions the principal can perform based on their roles.

### Step 6: Evaluate Derived Roles
- **Action:** Evaluate any derived roles for the principal based on specific conditions.
- **Logic:**
  - Query the `DerivedRoleModel` to retrieve all derived roles.
  - Evaluate the conditions in each derived role to see if they apply to the principal.
  - Collect applicable derived roles.
  - Query the `PolicyModel` collection for policies associated with these derived roles.
- **Output:** A list of derived role policies applicable to the principal.
- **Why it’s important:** Derived roles allow for dynamic role assignment based on specific attributes or conditions, offering more granular control.

### Step 7: Retrieve Resource Policies
- **Action:** Retrieve policies associated with the specified resource ARI.
- **Logic:**
  - Query the `PolicyModel` collection for documents where `resourcePolicy.resource` matches the given resource ARI.
  - Include policies that match the resource ARI using patterns (e.g., wildcard matches).
- **Output:** A list of resource policies applicable to the specific resource.
- **Why it’s important:** Resource policies directly control what actions can be performed on the resource, forming the second layer of access control.

### Step 8: Aggregate All Collected Policies
- **Action:** Combine all the policies collected from the principal, groups, roles, derived roles, and resource.
- **Logic:**
  - Merge policies by priority, starting with resource policies and overlaying them with principal, group, role, and derived role policies.
  - Consider conflicts (e.g., `EFFECT_DENY` overriding `EFFECT_ALLOW`).
- **Output:** A unified set of policies that dictate what actions the principal can perform on the resource.
- **Why it’s important:** Aggregating all policies ensures that all possible access rules are considered, allowing for a comprehensive evaluation of permissions.

### Step 9: Evaluate the Aggregated Policies
- **Action:** Determine whether the principal is allowed to perform the requested actions on the resource.
- **Logic:**
  - Iterate over the aggregated policies to check if any allow or deny the requested actions.
  - Apply conditions, if any, associated with the policies.
- **Output:** A final decision (e.g., ALLOW or DENY) regarding the principal’s access to the resource.
- **Why it’s important:** This is the final step where all gathered information is used to make an access control decision.

### Step 10: Return the Decision
- **Action:** Return the result of the policy evaluation process.
- **Output:** The result (ALLOW or DENY) of whether the principal can perform the requested actions on the resource.
- **Why it’s important:** This result will determine if the principal is permitted to access or modify the resource as requested.

### Example Scenario
Suppose we have a principal with the ID `user123`, who is trying to `edit` a file within a specific dataroom resource (`ari:agsiri:dataroom:us:448912311299-1:dataroom/cabinet/file/*`). The steps outlined above would be executed as follows:
1. Direct principal policies would be checked.
2. Group memberships are determined, and any associated group policies are collected.
3. The principal’s roles are evaluated, and corresponding role policies are gathered.
4. Derived roles are evaluated to see if any additional roles apply.
5. Resource policies specific to the dataroom or its components (cabinet, file) are retrieved.
6. All these policies are aggregated to form a comprehensive view of the principal's permissions.
7. The policies are evaluated to see if `edit` is allowed for `user123` on the specific file.
8. The final decision is returned based on the aggregated and evaluated policies.

This process allows for a detailed and thorough analysis of all possible access controls affecting the principal’s ability to interact with the resource.
