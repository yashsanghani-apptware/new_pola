# Pola Generative Policy Agent

## 1. Authorization Service
The `authRoutes.ts` file defines the API routes for handling user authentication within the Pola system. These routes are critical for securing access to the system by ensuring that only authenticated users can access protected resources. Let's review each route and its implications:

### **1. POST `/auth/login` - Login user and return JWT token**
- **Functionality**: This route handles user authentication by verifying the provided username and password. If the credentials are valid, it returns a JWT (JSON Web Token) that can be used for subsequent authenticated requests.
- **Use Case**: This is the primary entry point for users to authenticate and gain access to the system.
- **Considerations**:
  - **Security**: Ensure that user credentials are handled securely. Passwords should be hashed and compared securely, and any failed login attempts should be logged and possibly rate-limited to prevent brute force attacks.
  - **Response**: Upon successful login, a JWT token is issued, which the user will include in the Authorization header of subsequent requests to access protected routes.
  - **Error Handling**: Handle cases where the login fails due to incorrect credentials, and provide appropriate error messages without revealing too much information.

### **2. POST `/auth/refresh-token` - Refresh the JWT token**
- **Functionality**: This route allows users to refresh their JWT token before it expires. The user submits the current token, and if it is valid, a new token is issued.
- **Use Case**: Useful for maintaining session continuity without requiring the user to log in again. This is especially important for long-running sessions or applications where the user needs to remain logged in for an extended period.
- **Considerations**:
  - **Security**: Ensure that the token being refreshed is valid and hasn’t been tampered with. The refresh process should also verify that the user is still authorized to receive a new token (e.g., the user hasn’t been deactivated).
  - **Token Management**: Consider implementing token expiration and rotation policies to enhance security. Tokens should have a limited lifespan, and refresh tokens should also expire and require the user to log in again after a certain period.
  - **Error Handling**: Handle cases where the token is expired, invalid, or has been revoked, and provide appropriate error messages.

### **General Considerations for Authentication:**

- **JWT Security**: JWT tokens should be signed using a secure algorithm (e.g., HMAC SHA-256) and kept secret. The tokens should also be stored securely on the client side (e.g., in HTTP-only cookies or secure storage) to prevent unauthorized access.
  
- **Rate Limiting and Brute Force Protection**: Implement rate limiting on the login route to prevent brute force attacks. Consider integrating CAPTCHA or other mechanisms to detect and mitigate automated login attempts.

- **Session Management**: Although JWT is stateless, it’s important to have a strategy for session management, particularly in terms of invalidating tokens if a user logs out or if there’s a security concern (e.g., token compromise).

- **Logging and Monitoring**: Log all authentication attempts, both successful and unsuccessful. Monitoring these logs can help detect suspicious activity, such as repeated failed login attempts.

- **Error Messaging**: Be cautious with error messages. Ensure that they are informative enough to help legitimate users but do not provide details that could aid attackers (e.g., distinguishing between "user not found" and "incorrect password").

The routes in `authRoutes.ts` are fundamental to securing the Pola system. By handling authentication and token management, they ensure that only verified users can access the system's resources, and they help maintain secure sessions through token refreshes.
