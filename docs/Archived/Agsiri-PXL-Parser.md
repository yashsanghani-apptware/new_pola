Let's walk through the `PXLParser` class code step by step, explaining its functionality and internal workings. I'll also provide examples to illustrate how the code operates, focusing on how it interacts with MongoDB, builds contexts, and evaluates condition expressions.

### 1. **Overview of `PXLParser` Class:**
   - **Purpose:** The `PXLParser` class connects to a MongoDB database, builds execution contexts using user and resource identifiers, and evaluates condition expressions based on scenarios stored in the database.
   - **Key Components:**
     - **MongoDB Connection:** Handles connecting and disconnecting from the MongoDB database.
     - **Context Building:** Uses the `buildContext` function to gather all necessary data for evaluating conditions.
     - **Custom Operators:** Extends the evaluation context with custom operators.
     - **Expression Evaluation:** Evaluates expressions based on the built context.
     - **Scenario Execution:** Runs predefined scenarios by fetching them from the database and evaluating their conditions.

### 2. **Step-by-Step Breakdown of `PXLParser` Class:**

1. **Class Initialization:**
   - The `PXLParser` class is initialized with a MongoDB connection string.
   - Example:
     ```typescript
     const parser = new PXLParser('mongodb://localhost:27017/mydatabase');
     ```

2. **Connecting to MongoDB:**
   - The `connect` method establishes a connection to the MongoDB database using the provided connection string.
   - If successful, it logs a message; otherwise, it throws an error.
   - Example:
     ```typescript
     await parser.connect();
     ```

3. **Disconnecting from MongoDB:**
   - The `disconnect` method closes the MongoDB connection.
   - It logs a message upon successful disconnection or an error if the disconnection fails.
   - Example:
     ```typescript
     await parser.disconnect();
     ```

4. **Evaluating an Expression:**
   - The `evaluate` method takes an expression, user and resource identifiers, local variables, and global variables as input.
   - It builds a context using `buildContext`, adds custom operators to the context, and evaluates the expression within this context.
   - The evaluation result (true/false) is logged and returned.
   - Example:
     ```typescript
     const result = await parser.evaluate(
       'user.role === "admin" && resource.type === "document"',
       { userId: 'user123', resourceId: 'resource456' },
       { customVar: 'customValue' },
       { globalVar: 'globalValue' }
     );
     ```

5. **Running a Scenario:**
   - The `runScenario` method fetches a scenario by its ID from the MongoDB database.
   - It builds a context, evaluates the scenario's condition expression, and compares the actual result with the expected result stored in the scenario.
   - It logs whether the scenario passed or failed based on this comparison.
   - Example:
     ```typescript
     await parser.runScenario(
       'scenario123',
       { userId: 'user123', resourceId: 'resource456' },
       { customVar: 'customValue' },
       { globalVar: 'globalValue' }
     );
     ```

### 3. **Step-by-Step Breakdown of the Code Execution:**

1. **Initialization:**
   - The `PXLParser` class is instantiated with a MongoDB connection string, setting up the database connection configuration.
   - The `connect` method is called to establish the connection.

2. **Building Context in `evaluate` Method:**
   - The method starts by building the execution context using `buildContext`, which retrieves user and resource data and merges it with facts, blacklists, and variables.
   - Custom operators are added to the runtime context to extend the available operations during expression evaluation.

3. **Evaluating the Expression:**
   - The expression is evaluated using `evaluateConditionExpression`, which interprets the expression within the given context.
   - Example Expression: `'user.role === "admin" && resource.type === "document"'`
   - **Context:**
     ```json
     {
       "runtime": {
         "user": { "role": "admin", "department": "IT" },
         "resource": { "type": "document", "department": "IT" },
         "customVar": "customValue",
         "globalVar": "globalValue"
       }
     }
     ```

4. **Running a Scenario in `runScenario` Method:**
   - The method fetches the scenario from MongoDB by its ID.
   - It builds the context and evaluates the scenario's condition expression.
   - The evaluation result is compared with the expected result from the scenario, and the outcome (pass/fail) is logged.
   - Example Scenario:
     ```json
     {
       "_id": "scenario123",
       "expression": "user.role === 'admin' && resource.type === 'document'",
       "expected": true
     }
     ```
   - **Evaluation Result:**
     - If the expression evaluates to `true` and the expected result is `true`, the scenario passes.
     - If the evaluation result does not match the expected result, the scenario fails.

### 4. **Example Scenario for `runScenario`:**

- **Scenario:** 
  - **ID:** `scenario123`
  - **Expression:** `user.role === 'admin' && resource.type === 'document'`
  - **Expected Result:** `true`
- **Input:**
  - **User ID:** `user123`
  - **Resource ID:** `resource456`
  - **Local Variables:** `{ customVar: 'customValue' }`
  - **Globals:** `{ globalVar: 'globalValue' }`
- **Context:**
  ```json
  {
    "runtime": {
      "user": { "role": "admin", "department": "IT" },
      "resource": { "type": "document", "department": "IT" },
      "customVar": "customValue",
      "globalVar": "globalValue"
    }
  }
  ```
- **Evaluation:**
  - The expression evaluates to `true`, matching the expected result.
  - The scenario passes.

### Summary:

The `PXLParser` class is responsible for connecting to a MongoDB database, building execution contexts using various identifiers, and evaluating conditions within those contexts. The class allows for both direct expression evaluation and scenario-based evaluation, which is essential for policy testing and enforcement. The context built by `PXLParser` is enriched with user data, resource data, facts, blacklists, and custom variables, ensuring comprehensive and accurate evaluations.
