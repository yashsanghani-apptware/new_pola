# Concept Note: Extending the Pola Policy Framework to Incorporate `eventPolicy`

## **1. Introduction**

The Pola Policy Framework is a robust and flexible policy management system designed to govern and protect resources, users, roles, and groups across an organization. Currently, the framework supports six primary policy types: `principalPolicy`, `resourcePolicy`, `rolePolicy`, `groupPolicy`, `derivedRoles`, and `exportVariables`. These policy types enable organizations to define permissions, roles, and access controls comprehensively.

To further enhance the capabilities of Pola, we propose the addition of a new policy type: `eventPolicy`. The `eventPolicy` will enable organizations to define policies that respond to specific events within the system, allowing for real-time enforcement of rules, automated actions, and dynamic responses to changing conditions. This extension will integrate seamlessly with the existing policy types, creating a unified framework that supports both static and event-driven policies.

## **2. Objectives**

The primary objectives of integrating `eventPolicy` into the Pola Policy Framework are as follows:

- **Event-Driven Automation**: Enable the system to automatically respond to specific events, such as user actions or system changes, without manual intervention.
- **Real-Time Policy Enforcement**: Allow policies to be triggered based on real-time events, ensuring immediate enforcement of rules and regulations.
- **Enhanced Security and Compliance**: Strengthen the security posture by responding to suspicious or unauthorized activities as they occur, enhancing compliance with organizational policies.
- **Seamless Integration**: Ensure that the `eventPolicy` integrates seamlessly with the existing policy types, allowing for complex, multi-layered policy enforcement.

## **3. Existing Policy Types**

Before diving into the integration of `eventPolicy`, it is important to review the existing policy types in the Pola Policy Framework:

- **`principalPolicy`**: Defines rules for specific principals, such as users, groups, or roles, determining what actions they are allowed or denied on specific resources.
  
- **`resourcePolicy`**: Specifies permissions and conditions for accessing or modifying resources within the system, governing how resources are managed and interacted with.
  
- **`rolePolicy`**: Assigns permissions to roles, allowing roles to encapsulate a set of permissions that can be easily managed and applied to multiple users or groups.
  
- **`groupPolicy`**: Applies policies to groups of users, enabling collective management of permissions and access rights based on group membership.
  
- **`derivedRoles`**: Allows for the creation of roles that are derived from existing roles, with additional conditions or constraints applied.
  
- **`exportVariables`**: Defines variables that can be exported and used across different policies, enabling dynamic policy configurations based on shared data.

## **4. Proposed Extension: `eventPolicy`**

### **4.1. Overview**

The `eventPolicy` type introduces a new dimension to the Pola Policy Framework by allowing policies to be triggered by specific events within the system. These events can be user actions (e.g., login, file upload), system states (e.g., CPU usage exceeds a threshold), or any other detectable occurrence. The `eventPolicy` can define conditions that must be met for the policy to be activated and specify actions to be taken when the policy is triggered.

### **4.2. Key Components of `eventPolicy`**

- **Events**: The specific occurrences that trigger the `eventPolicy`. These can include system events (e.g., server crash, high memory usage), user actions (e.g., login, file access), or other predefined signals within the system.
  
- **Conditions**: Logical expressions that determine whether the event should trigger the policy. These conditions can be based on the context of the event, such as the time of day, the role of the user, or the state of a resource.
  
- **Actions**: The operations to be performed when the policy is triggered. These actions can include notifications, access restrictions, resource modifications, or any other system operation that needs to be automated in response to the event.

### **4.3. Example of `eventPolicy`**

Here is a sample `eventPolicy` that triggers a notification when an admin user logs in outside of business hours:

```json
{
  "apiVersion": "api.pola.dev/v1",
  "eventPolicy": {
    "events": [
      {
        "on": ["userLogin"],
        "condition": {
          "match": {
            "all": {
              "of": [
                { "expr": "user.role === 'admin'" },
                { "expr": "time.hour >= 18 || time.hour <= 8" }
              ]
            }
          }
        },
        "actions": [
          {
            "type": "sendNotification",
            "parameters": {
              "message": "Admin login detected outside business hours.",
              "recipient": "securityTeam@example.com"
            }
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "auditInfo": {
      "createdBy": "securityAdmin",
      "createdAt": "2024-08-23T12:00:00Z",
      "updatedBy": "securityAdmin",
      "updatedAt": "2024-08-23T12:00:00Z"
    }
  }
}
```

This example demonstrates how the `eventPolicy` listens for the `userLogin` event, checks if the user is an admin and if the login is outside of business hours, and then sends a notification to the security team.

### **4.4. Integration with Existing Policies**

The `eventPolicy` will integrate with the existing policy types as follows:

- **`principalPolicy` Integration**: `eventPolicy` can be used to trigger actions when specific principals (users, roles, groups) perform certain actions. For example, a `principalPolicy` might define that only admins can access certain resources, and an `eventPolicy` can monitor for unauthorized access attempts.

- **`resourcePolicy` Integration**: `eventPolicy` can monitor events related to resources, such as changes in resource state or unauthorized access attempts. For instance, if a resource is modified unexpectedly, an `eventPolicy` can trigger an investigation.

- **`rolePolicy` Integration**: `eventPolicy` can trigger actions based on role-based events, such as when a user is assigned a new role. This ensures that role assignments are monitored and validated in real-time.

- **`groupPolicy` Integration**: `eventPolicy` can be used to respond to changes in group membership or activities involving specific groups. For example, if a high-privilege group performs certain actions, the system can automatically enforce additional security measures.

- **`derivedRoles` Integration**: `eventPolicy` can dynamically adjust or respond to events involving derived roles. For instance, if a derived role is activated under certain conditions, the system can automatically adjust permissions or notify administrators.

- **`exportVariables` Integration**: `eventPolicy` can interact with `exportVariables` to make dynamic decisions based on shared data. For example, variables exported from one policy can be used as conditions in an `eventPolicy` to ensure consistency across the system.

## **5. Event Policy Schema**

To formalize the integration of `eventPolicy`, the following schema defines its structure:

```json
{
  "$id": "https://api.pola.dev/v1.3.2/agsiri/policy/v1/eventPolicy.schema.json",
  "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "apiVersion": {
      "type": "string",
      "const": "api.pola.dev/v1"
    },
    "eventPolicy": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "events": {
          "type": "array",
          "items": {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
              "on": {
                "type": "array",
                "items": {
                  "type": "string"
                },
                "minItems": 1
              },
              "once": {
                "type": "array",
                "items": {
                  "type": "string"
                },
                "minItems": 0
              },
              "condition": {
                "$ref": "#/definitions/pola.policy.v1.Condition"
              },
              "actions": {
                "type": "array",
                "items": {
                  "type": "object",
                  "properties": {
                    "type": {
                      "type": "string"
                    },
                    "parameters": {
                      "type": "object",
                      "additionalProperties": true
                    }
                  }
                }
              }
            },
            "required": ["on", "actions"]
          }
        },
        "auditInfo": {
          "$ref": "#/definitions/pola.policy.v1.AuditInfo"
        }
      },
      "required": ["events", "auditInfo"]
    }
  }
}
```

## **6. Implementation Considerations**

### **6.1. Compatibility and Backward Compatibility**

The introduction of `eventPolicy` will be designed to maintain full backward compatibility with existing policy types. Organizations using the Pola Policy Framework can adopt `eventPolicy` gradually without impacting their existing policies.

### **6.2. Performance Implications**

Real-time event processing and policy enforcement will require optimized handling of events to ensure that the system remains responsive and scalable. Consideration will be given to event queuing, rate-limiting, and caching strategies to manage performance.

### **6.3. Security and Auditing**

As with all policy types, `eventPolicy` will be subject to strict security and auditing standards. All events, conditions, and actions will be logged, and the audit trail will be integrated with the existing auditing mechanisms in Pola.

### **6.4. Developer and User Experience**

The addition of `

eventPolicy` will be accompanied by comprehensive documentation, including examples, best practices, and tools for defining, testing, and deploying event-driven policies. User interfaces and APIs will be updated to support the creation and management of `eventPolicy` alongside existing policies.

## **7. Conclusion**

The introduction of `eventPolicy` to the Pola Policy Framework represents a significant advancement in policy management, enabling organizations to automate responses to real-time events and enforce policies dynamically. By integrating seamlessly with the existing policy types, `eventPolicy` will provide a powerful tool for enhancing security, compliance, and operational efficiency across the organization.

This concept note outlines the rationale, objectives, and technical considerations for integrating `eventPolicy` into the Pola Policy Framework. The next steps include schema finalization, implementation planning, and iterative development to bring this vision to life.
