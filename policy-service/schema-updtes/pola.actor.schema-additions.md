When evaluating policies for actors, considering **Facts** and **Blacklist** entries can provide a more nuanced and dynamic decision-making process. Letâ€™s brainstorm the key attributes and options for each of these objects.

### 1. **Facts Object**

**Definition**:  
A **Fact** represents a contextual truth or condition about an actor or its environment that has been observed or recorded at a specific point in time. Facts can be dynamic and may change over time, providing critical insights for evaluating policies.

#### **Key Attributes:**
1. **id** (string):  
   Unique identifier for the Fact.

2. **actorId** (string):  
   Reference to the actor (User, Group, Role, or Resource) the Fact is associated with.

3. **type** (string):  
   The type of Fact, such as `"usage"`, `"location"`, `"behavior"`, `"access"`, `"environment"`, etc.  
   - *Options*: `"usage"`, `"location"`, `"behavior"`, `"access"`, `"environment"`, `"activity"`, etc.

4. **value** (any):  
   The value or content of the Fact. This could be a simple value (like a string or number) or a complex object depending on the Fact type.  
   - *Options*: Could be a range (e.g., "high", "medium", "low"), a numeric threshold, or a descriptive string.

5. **timestamp** (Date):  
   The time when the Fact was recorded or observed.

6. **source** (string):  
   The origin of the Fact (e.g., `"system"`, `"manual-entry"`, `"sensor"`, `"third-party"`).  
   - *Options*: `"system"`, `"manual"`, `"sensor"`, `"user-input"`, `"external-service"`.

7. **confidenceLevel** (string):  
   An indicator of how reliable the Fact is.  
   - *Options*: `"high"`, `"medium"`, `"low"`.

8. **expiresAt** (Date, optional):  
   The expiration date of the Fact, if it is only valid for a certain period.

9. **context** (object, optional):  
   Additional metadata or contextual details related to the Fact (e.g., environmental conditions, specific circumstances).

10. **tags** (array of strings, optional):  
    Tags to categorize or label the Fact for easy search and retrieval.  
    - *Options*: `"temporary"`, `"critical"`, `"anomaly"`, etc.

11. **linkedPolicies** (array of strings, optional):  
    List of policy IDs that are directly impacted or related to this Fact.

#### **Beneficial Attributes/Options:**
- **severity** (string):  
  Indicates the importance or urgency of the Fact in decision-making.  
  - *Options*: `"critical"`, `"high"`, `"medium"`, `"low"`.
  
- **history** (array of objects):  
  Historical records of changes or updates to the Fact over time.  
  - Each entry might include attributes like `changedAt` (Date) and `oldValue` (any).

- **location** (string, optional):  
  Geographical or logical location where the Fact was observed. Useful for location-based policies.

- **actionable** (boolean, optional):  
  Whether the Fact can trigger automatic actions or alerts within the system.

### 2. **Blacklist Object**

**Definition**:  
A **Blacklist** entry represents a restriction or prohibition against an actor based on specific criteria or behavior. Blacklisting can be temporary or permanent and may apply to various actions or access types.

#### **Key Attributes:**
1. **id** (string):  
   Unique identifier for the Blacklist entry.

2. **actorId** (string):  
   Reference to the actor (User, Group, Role, or Resource) that is blacklisted.

3. **reason** (string):  
   The reason for blacklisting the actor (e.g., `"security breach"`, `"policy violation"`, `"suspicious activity"`).  
   - *Options*: `"security breach"`, `"policy violation"`, `"non-compliance"`, `"fraudulent behavior"`, `"anomaly detection"`.

4. **actionsRestricted** (array of strings):  
   List of specific actions that are restricted for the blacklisted actor (e.g., `"access"`, `"update"`, `"delete"`).  
   - *Options*: `"read"`, `"write"`, `"execute"`, `"delete"`, `"create"`.

5. **startTime** (Date):  
   The time when the blacklisting became effective.

6. **endTime** (Date, optional):  
   The expiration time for the blacklist entry, if it is temporary.

7. **source** (string):  
   The origin of the Blacklist entry (e.g., `"system"`, `"manual"`, `"external service"`).  
   - *Options*: `"system"`, `"user-input"`, `"admin-decision"`, `"third-party"`.

8. **severity** (string):  
   The level of severity associated with the blacklisting.  
   - *Options*: `"high"`, `"medium"`, `"low"`.

9. **context** (object, optional):  
   Additional metadata or contextual information related to the blacklisting decision.

10. **linkedFacts** (array of strings, optional):  
    List of Fact IDs that support or contribute to the blacklisting decision.

11. **tags** (array of strings, optional):  
    Tags to categorize or label the Blacklist entry for easy search and retrieval.  
    - *Options*: `"temporary"`, `"critical"`, `"anomaly"`, etc.

#### **Beneficial Attributes/Options:**
- **reviewDate** (Date, optional):  
  The date when the blacklist entry is scheduled for review to determine whether it should be lifted or extended.

- **reviewer** (string, optional):  
  The ID of the person or system responsible for reviewing the blacklist entry.

- **autoLift** (boolean, optional):  
  Indicates if the blacklist entry should be automatically lifted when certain conditions are met (e.g., time expiration, resolution of issue).

- **conditions** (object, optional):  
  Specific conditions that must be met for the blacklist entry to be lifted. This could include metrics or KPIs that are monitored.

- **notifiedParties** (array of strings, optional):  
  List of stakeholders or systems notified about the blacklist entry.  
  - *Options*: `"user"`, `"admin"`, `"security-team"`, `"third-party"`.

- **history** (array of objects):  
  Records of changes or updates to the blacklist entry over time, useful for auditing.  
  - Each entry might include `changedAt` (Date), `oldStatus` (string), `newStatus` (string), and `changedBy` (string).

### **Integration and Usage Considerations**

1. **Integration with Policy Evaluation:**
   - During policy evaluation, both **Facts** and **Blacklist** entries can provide crucial inputs to determine whether an action should be allowed or denied.
   - **Facts** can help make dynamic decisions based on current or historical context.
   - **Blacklist** entries can enforce restrictions and prohibitions, preventing actors from performing certain actions.

2. **Data Management and Governance:**
   - Regular updates and validations of Facts and Blacklist entries are necessary to ensure they remain relevant and accurate.
   - Attributes like `expiresAt`, `reviewDate`, and `confidenceLevel` can help manage data lifecycle and ensure governance.

3. **Monitoring and Alerting:**
   - Attributes like `severity`, `actionable`, and `notifiedParties` can be used to trigger alerts or notifications to relevant stakeholders when a Fact or Blacklist entry is created or modified.

4. **Security and Privacy:**
   - Ensure that sensitive information within Facts or Blacklist entries is appropriately protected and accessed only by authorized entities.
   - Use attributes like `context` to provide granular control over data visibility and usage.

By defining these attributes and considering the options, we can create robust Facts and Blacklist objects that significantly enhance the policy evaluation process, providing a more dynamic, responsive, and secure system.
